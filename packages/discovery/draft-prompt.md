You are editing a GitHub repository to add installation instructions for the sk tool.

Intent
- Add sk installation instructions for this package in an appropriate, visible location.
- Use the repository's existing tone and structure. Be helpful, not promotional.

Package
- Name: {{PACKAGE_NAME}}
- Description: {{PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION}}
- Declaration: {{DECLARATION}}

Commands to add
These are the exact commands to add, as two separate lines (in this order):
{{INSTALL_COMMAND}}

Guidance
- Prefer README.md or the most relevant docs file if there is a dedicated installation section.
- If an Installation or Getting Started section exists, add the sk instructions there. Otherwise create a small subsection.
- Do not remove or rewrite existing instructions; only add sk instructions.
- Keep the addition concise and respectful of the existing style.
