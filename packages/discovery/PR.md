`sk` is a universal package manager for agent skills (npm/cargo for agents). it works across most coding agents, handles updates, and more. It installs skills using the native installation location for each coding agent.

It also supports loading skills from claude-plugins (it'll extract the skill folders and put it into the right spot for other agents)

would you be open to adding this?
